This is the first homework. A programatic approach to create Piet Mondrian popular painting(https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/447193437988641510/?autologin=true).

I initially created all vertical and horizontal bars with a pure white background.
Then I created some boxes (recentangles) with specific colors among the bars.
Initially I did not that I can print the mouseX and mouseY on the surface. That is why
I drew the Mondrian image on the surface and positioned everything with try and error.

Then I added all the non white boxes and used the "Digital Color Meter" on mac to fill the box with identical color.
The Digital Color Meter verified that the color of some of the boxes are not consistent. I tried to choose an RGB that
represents the whole box. 

Hint about misunderstanding on collaboration:
I started the skeleton of this project and created a separate branch for Ramya to continue. Then we figured that this is a solo project. She stopped working on it. I ignored the commits in her branch, and merged my final changes in the master branch. I did not even read her changes to avoid any kind of collaboration.
